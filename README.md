# Perception Experiments 🔬

This repository contains a set of small, focused experiments exploring **visual perception and spatial understanding** using computer vision techniques.

The goal is not to optimize for benchmark performance, but to understand how different approaches behave under **practical constraints** such as lighting variation, motion, noise, and limited data.

Each experiment documents the **problem setup, approach, observations, and trade-offs**, with an emphasis on *why* certain methods work or fail in applied settings.

## Scope
- Classical and learning-based computer vision methods  
- Small-scale perception pipelines  
- Emphasis on experimentation and observation  

## Status
Work in progress. Experiments will be added incrementally.
