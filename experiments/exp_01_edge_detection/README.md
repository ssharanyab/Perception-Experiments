# Experiment 01: Edge Detection Under Varying Lighting

## Problem
Edge detection is a fundamental step in many perception pipelines. This experiment explores how classical edge detection methods behave under different lighting conditions.

## Methods
- Sobel
- Canny

## Setup
- Input images captured or selected under varying lighting conditions
- No preprocessing beyond grayscale conversion
- Same parameters applied across conditions

## Observations

## Trade-offs
