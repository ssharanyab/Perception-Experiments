## Questions
- What exactly qualifies as an "edge"?
- Why does lighting variation create false edges?
- Why does Canny use two thresholds?

## Initial intuition
- Edges correspond to strong intensity changes.
- Noise can look like edges to simple detectors.
- Canny seems more selective but more complex.

## Things I don't understand yet
- How sensitive Canny thresholds really are
- When Sobel is preferable in practice
